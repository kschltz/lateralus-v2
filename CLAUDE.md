# kb — Kanban Board Workflow

This project uses `kb` for task management. The board is a communication tool — it tells the story of your work.

## Working with the Board

1. `kb status` — see all lanes and cards
2. `kb pull --lane in-progress --agent claude` — claim the next card
3. Work in the card's worktree (shown in pull output)
4. `kb decision <id> "what I tried, learned, decided"` — record a decision (primary progress signal)
5. `kb note <id> "msg"` — log a quick note or status update
6. `kb ask <id> "question"` — ask the human (blocks card until answered)
7. `kb log <id>` — check for human notes or answers before each major step
8. `kb heartbeat <id>` — signal you are still working
9. `kb advance <id>` — move card to next lane (advisory by default — warnings shown, not blocking)
10. `kb done <id>` — move card to final lane

## How to Record Decisions

Before advancing to a new lane, record what you did and why:
  `kb decision 042 "Tried X. Failed because Y. Decided Z."`

Decisions are the primary progress signal. They tell the story of your work.
Notes are for quick updates. Decisions are for reasoning.

## Rules

- Always work inside the card's worktree, not the main tree
- Use `kb context <id>` for lean card context (add `--full` for comprehensive)
- Record decisions before advancing — `has-decision-record?` is the gate
- Lane advisories guide you but don't block by default (only `strict: true` lanes block)
- Gate failures are advisory by default — read warnings, decide if you should fix
- Advance through lanes sequentially — do not skip lanes
